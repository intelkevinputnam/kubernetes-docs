Welcome to Intel®'s Kubernetes\* Documentation Site!
====================================================
Intel® is committed to furthering open cloud innovation to support
data-centric, edge-distributed workloads of the future and provide greater
computing performance, speed, security, storage, networking and more. Our
early contributions to Kubernetes helped extend capabilities by shaping the
architecture and requirements for device plugins, address limitations for a
variety of high-bandwidth, low-latency workloads, such as CPU pinning and node
feature discovery, and enable new features for use in networking applications
such as multiple network interfaces and single root I/O virtualization.

Today, we’re continuing to collaborate across the Kubernetes community and
ecosystem to deliver best-fit performance and security for cloud native
workloads, ease the developer experience, and pave the way for tomorrow.

In this site, you will find detailed documentation and technical guides of
each project that we support.
